Brief description of our project:
We are doing a standard project and creating a web app that will use data from the Duke police to allow users to interact with a database of crimes and locations reported on Duke’s campus. Duke Police provide weekly status reports on crime in the Durham area at this website: http://police.duke.edu/news_stats/summaries/index.php. We would like to use a map on the web app to let users visually interpret the data, and we are considering using http://maplacejs.com/ to help integrate this feature.

Plan for populating the database:
We plan to scrape the individual reports to build our database.

Description of Web Interface:
Our app called “crimeloc” will feature a map through which users can see data about crime reports on and around Duke’s campus. Users will be able to select multiple different attributes of a crime, such as date, time, location, and type. Crimes with these attributes will appear on the map, and users will be able to click on the icons to read more about the specific incident (get the attributes they didn’t previously select).
